# SPL Alpha prototype

This prototype is built using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) and [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). The documentation for these two services provides everything that you will need to know to work with this code.

The protoype collects multiple small services developed during the alpha phase of the SPL project.

**Note:** This project is for the alpha phase only! It should not be used as anything more than a general blueprint for the beta phase and in particular is not suitable as a base project for expanding or tweaking into something production-ready.

## Getting started on development

### Installs

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or your favourite text editor)

### Set up

Once you have cloned the code with Git. Navigate to the root of the project and install NPM packages:
```
npm install
```

### Running the project

Once NPM packages have been installed, run the project locally with:
```
npm start
