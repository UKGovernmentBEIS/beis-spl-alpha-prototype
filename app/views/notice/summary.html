          If your partner is also taking shared parental leave and pay, you can <a href="/notice/reset" class="govuk-link">start again</a> to generate their notices.
          You will not need to re-enter their personal information.

        <p>
          If your shared parental leave starts before the mother goes back to work, the mother must give her employer notice to XXXXX[curtail her maternity entitlement.] (I think we should provide an empty curtailment notice form)XXXX

          If the mother is also taking shared parental leave and pay, you can <a href="/notice/reset" class="govuk-link">start again</a>  to generate her notices.
