      <p>
        You can use this service to complete the notices and declarations required to take shared parental leave and pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        These forms can be completed online, but you’ll need to print, sign and give them to your employer 8 weeks before your first block of shared parental leave starts.
        Your employer may have their own forms they’d prefer you to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Both</strong> parents need to give certain notices and declarations for <strong>either</strong> parent to take shared parental leave and pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll need to provide:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          Name, address and national insurance numbers for both you and your partner
        </li>
        <li>
          Dates and duration of maternity and shared parental leave and pay
        </li>
      </ul>
      {{ govukButton({
        text: "Start now",
        href: "/notice/birth-or-adoption",
        classes: "govuk-button--start"
      }) }}
